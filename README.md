We  are team TAM and this is a project to simulate the FTP server locally using Java for send and retrieve files. We also use MongoDB to implement login functions.

Our implementation is based on this reference: https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/ftp.html

To run the application, open the project with Maven and compile the Server.java and Client.java to send commands and receive results.
